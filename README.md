# FruitDetector

Fruit Detector is a bare-bones SwiftUI app that runs a CNN that can classify a fruit from one of the following categories:
- Apple
- Avocado
- Banana
- Cherry
- Kiwi
- Mango
- Orange
- Pineapple
- Strawberries
- Watermelon

The model was trained with 98% accuracy in a Kaggle notebook. Then, it was exported and converted into a .mlpackage file to be used by the Swift app.
